# Output

Output is by means of [jinja2](https://jinja2docs.readthedocs.io/en/stable/)
templates, which have access to `Result()` objects containing very nearly every
step of the process, so output can be quite powerful.  For more ideas, see the
example templates and the [demosite template](https://github.com/2e0byo/gallica-autobib-demosite/tree/master/backend/app/templates).
